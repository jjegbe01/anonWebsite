Hey /v/.
I've got an idea, lets make a guide of graphical features to be free to use to everyone on the board.
Everyone should be able to participate by making corrections, suggestions and offering comparison screenshots.

First step: Gather a list of graphical features and screenshots (in ".png" , ".tga" or ".tiff" format).
Second step: Divide and subdivide (Antialias: SSAA/FXAA/SMAA...)
Third step: Make a short summary of the use of the feature and its types.
Fourth step: Add comparison screenshots.
Fifth step: ?
